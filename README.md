CSE 110 Lab 3: CSS + Agile

Click [here](https://ntrappe.github.io/wi21-cse110-lab3/) to view the hosted GitHub Pages site. Otherwise, the ONLY html file is `index.html` and the external CSS doc is `style.css`.

For the TA, if you want to make your life easier, check out `standup_notes.md`. It's got all the notes but I also included examples of all the elements that exist. 

For example:

- [x] General sibling combinator (element ~ element)
    ```css
        code ~ code[class="src"] {
           color: aquamarine;
        }
    ```
